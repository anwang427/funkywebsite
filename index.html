    <h4>Hi there!</h4>
    <p>
      I'm Anna, a programmer, thinker, artist, and designer. I create work centered around social equality / empowerment and the environment; my projects are driven by a desire
      for a more fulfilling and eco-friendly future. This year, I moved from Western Canada to study Systems Design Engineering at UWaterloo, with the intent of designing and 
      building projects that can positively benefit the world. <br>
      <br>
      Currently/recently: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgBO12kmxVGeFHoh02WcFxaOdABstO71/view?usp=sharing">Built</a> wheelchair pressure sensors to alleviate health issues stemming from lack of mobility, founded venture to create atmospheric water harvesters for 
      less fortunate communities, and served as project coordinator for The Hot Potato Initiative, where I transcribed and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-hot-potato-initiative/peter-tom-and-judy/812676805735548/">published</a> personal interviews with homeless individuals
      to combat pervasive stigma.

      Presently, I am working with Ritual.co as a technical operations analyst.<br>
      <br>
      My interests: I'm curious about the shaping of human values, accelerating tech development, and creating entrepreneurial ventures. In my spare time, I pursue theatre acting, 
      play guitar, and make digital art. I also occasionally write poetry.
